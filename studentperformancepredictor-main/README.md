**Project**: Automated Academic Performance Predictor

**Objective**: Develop a machine learning model predicting student marks using writing and reading scores, test preparation, race/ethnicity, and gender.

**Key Features**:
- CI/CD Integration for streamlined development and deployment.
- MLOps implementation for end-to-end automation in the ML lifecycle.
- Efficient model deployment with a focus on scalability.
- Ethical considerations in handling demographic data to prevent biases.
- Streamlined Deployment Processes on the Microsoft Azure Platform
- Documentation for transparency and collaboration.
    
**Tools**: CI/CD pipelines, MLOps practices, version control.
